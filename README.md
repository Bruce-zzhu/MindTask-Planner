## Inspiration
People often have many _deadline-oriented tasks_ (DOT) and need to monitor the current progress of one or multiple DOTs. 

Most people tend to be over-optimistic about what they can achieve in the long term. This could be due to the lack of experience, but is more likely caused by procrastination and not having an actual overview of their plans. For example, Bruce has two tasks to do, the second one is much heavier than the first one, but Bruce thinks he has done half of the plan after finishing the first task. The situation could be worse if the number of tasks is getting larger. 

MindTask Planner is created to help organize tasks and sub-tasks in a better way and track the progress of our projects/plans.

## What it does
While a project can usually contain multiple tasks and even sub-tasks, users can plan their project on a mind map which provides a clear view of  **tasks hierarchy**. Other than that,  users can create a task with an _Estimated Time Used_ (ETU). ETU works as a unit of the estimated cost of time for a specific task, which can be defined by users themselves (e.g. 1 ETU = 0.5 hours). Users can check the progress of a whole project by checking how many ETUs have been completed instead of how many tasks have been done. This will generate a more realistic result of **progress overview**.

MindTask Planner is a good fit for small and medium-size projects management for individuals.
